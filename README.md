## Getting Started

### Oracle Streaming Analytics (OSA)
OSA is available in many ways:
- On-Premises software
- As part of oracle data integrator
- as part of data integration platform cloud (DIPC v18.2+)
- as part of oracle integration cloud service 

Fortunately the kind folk of the internet have provided a docker image to be our little playground :smiley:

#### OSA v12
The v12 image is pretty much stolen from the interwebs and adapted. 
I got it to work by bashing into the container but I wouldn't recommend using it unless you are ready to troubleshoot...

#### OSA v18.1 
I did it! it should work just by running `docker-compose up` but if it doesn't let me know!
Right now everything is running in one container but I'll probably set it up for multiple containers 
before giving the oracle/docker-images repo a PR :smiley:
